Each user of Islands can run their own Island and contribute to the system. An attack on any single node on the system will not take the system down. Finding all the nodes will be difficult (since network traffic is encrypted and routed through TOR anonymizers) and becomes increasingly difficult with more people running Islands nodes.}

This is best limited to small numbers of guest users, as concentrating many guests on one Island creates a centralized point to attack.
