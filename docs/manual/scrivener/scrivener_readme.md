The files under this folder are source files from Scrivener, a word processing program availible from [Literature and Late](http://literatureandlate.com). It is not free as in speech nor free as in beer, but the original author of this manual prefers to use it for large projects because of its orginizational features.

The Scrivener project files are not intended for public consumption; rather, Scrivener can compile and export documents in the various required formats.

Owning a copy of Scrivener is not required to submit to this project but there are some caveats:

Scrivener stores text in Rich Text (.rtf) format. In theory, a contributer can edit the source files with any compatable word processor and they will behave with Git. In practice, who knows.

Any changes made directly to generated output files will have to be manually integrated into the Scrivener project. If a project contibutor fails to notice they've been changed, there is a risk those changes will be overwritten when new files are generated.

Don't mess with the raw project files unless you know what you're doing. Having to roll back because someone nuked a configuration file would be annoying. (If you've forked away from the main branch that I'm working on and have no intention to merge stuff back in, mess all you want.)
