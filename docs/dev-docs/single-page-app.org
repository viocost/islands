#+TITLE: Single page app requirements

Chat, file transfer, chat admin, island admin, file transfer admin, updates.
I think that's the "tasks" that the user performs with the single-page app.

1. Single page app must be a "frame" that holds all other apps
2. The following apps are defined at the moment:
   * Chat
   * Islands admin
   * File transfer
