# Islands

Islands is a decentralized network built on the principles of anonymity, verifiability and user ownership, which serves as a platform for communication apps. It runs independently of any central authority and routes traffic through built-in TOR relays. For more details, refer to the Islands Manual.

The Islands server runs on Linux and is distributed to Mac and Windows as a virtual machine, managed by Islands Manager. Builds of Islands are distributed through BitTorrent magnet links. A plan to reliably push updates of new builds is pending.

This repository contains the Islands core implementation and the Islands Chat application. It is a base on which others can build their own implementations if they wish.
