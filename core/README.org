#+TITLE Building core

Core package contains all necessary scripts for building islands core

To make a core release run linux-build.sh on Linux, mac-build.sh on MacOS and
win-build.bat on Windows. Provide release dir as -p option. That will
automatically build all binaries and copy all scripts to the release dir.
Once release dir is built - the islands are ready to use, copy or distribute.
